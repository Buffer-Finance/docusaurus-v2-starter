# Fee

## Settlement Fee:

Settlement Fee (or trading fee) is the fee paid by takers (traders) to the makers (LPs). For above/below options, Settlement Fee (SF) is a function of market skew (s), a metric reflecting trade imbalance. 
Positive skew (s > 0) indicates a market leaning towards either up or down trades, and here, SF linearly scales between a base fee (B) and a maximum fee (M) as per SF Above = B + ((M - B)/S)*s. 
For negative skew (s < 0), signifying an atypical market, SF inversely adjusts, reducing below the base fee as per SF Down = B - (B/S)*s. 
This approach dynamically adjusts fees based on market imbalances.

## Platform Fee:

Placing Up/Down trades on Buffer incurs a flat fee for interactions on Buffer's 1 Click architecture that enables a 2x faster, and full gasless trading experience. 
This is a fixed amount used to cover the Router fee for opening & closing a trade. 


## Fee Distribution:

100% of the settlement fee is distributed between (aBLP & uBLP LPs), $BFR Stakers and $BFR Buyback and Burn.
