# Optopi Collection

:::note
We are in the process of enhancing the utility of Optopi NFT to version v2.5.1. During this upgrade, payout boosts will not be available in the new version. 
Users wishing to utilize boosts during trades can do so through the [Classic Buffer app](https://classic.app.buffer.finance/).
:::

Optopi is a collection of 8,888 unique, collectible PFP-friendly NFTs on Arbitrum. Each Optopus NFT offers key utility to traders on the Buffer Finance Platform. 

The collection is divided into four tiers: 
- Diamond
- Platinum
- Gold
- Silver

Diamond is the rarest to mint, and Silver is the most common.

## Adopt your own Optopus: 
Mint directly on [Buffer](https://optopi.buffer.finance/) or buy on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/the-optopi-collection).

## NFT-Based Payout Boosts:
Users with NFTs can unlock additional discounts on coupon prices based on their NFT tiers for a specified period of time. 
Owning higher-tier NFTs provides users with greater price reductions when purchasing coupons. 
The boost % depends on the tier of the NFT being held (highest tier = max payout boost, lowest tier = least payout boost).

Here’s how the NFT boost/NFT tier affects the base payout for traders: 
- Silver: 2%
- Gold: 4%
- Platinum: 6%
- Diamond: 8%

NFT payout is automatically applied when a trader holding an Optopi opens a trade on Buffer. 
The contract checks for a coupon, the NFT, and its tier, and automatically applies the payout boost on the open trade.
