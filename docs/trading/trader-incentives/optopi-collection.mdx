# Optopi Collection

:::note
We are in the process of enhancing the utility of Optopi NFT to version v2.6. During this upgrade, payout boosts will not be available in the new version. 
:::

Optopi is a collection of 8,888 unique, collectible PFP-friendly NFTs on Arbitrum. Each Optopus NFT offers key utility to traders on the Buffer Finance Platform. 

The collection is divided into four tiers: 
- Diamond
- Platinum
- Gold
- Silver

Diamond is the rarest to mint, and Silver is the most common.

## Adopt your own Optopus: 
Mint directly on [Buffer](https://optopi.buffer.finance/) or buy on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/the-optopi-collection).

:::warning
Whenever buying an NFT on OpenSea, please ensure to verify that you are buying a legitimate one by checking the contract addresses here.

## NFT-Based Payout Boosts:
Users with NFTs can unlock additional discounts on coupon prices based on their NFT tiers for a specified period of time. 
Owning higher-tier NFTs provides users with greater price reductions when purchasing coupons. 
The boost % depends on the tier of the NFT being held (highest tier = max payout boost, lowest tier = least payout boost).

Here‚Äôs how the NFT boost/NFT tier affects the base payout for traders: 
- Silver: 2%
- Gold: 4%
- Platinum: 6%
- Diamond: 8%

NFT payout is automatically applied when a trader holding an Optopi opens a trade on Buffer. 
The contract checks for a coupon, the NFT, and its tier, and automatically applies the payout boost on the open trade.
