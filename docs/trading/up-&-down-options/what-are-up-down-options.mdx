# What are Up/Down Markets?

![Interactive Image](/img/general/u:d-interact.png)

Up/Down markets are a type of derivative contract that turns every trade into a simple 'Up' or 'Down' question â€“ 
you decide whether a market is likely to be above a certain price, at a certain time. 
If you think it will be, you open a 'Up' position. If you think it wonâ€™t be, you open a 'Down' position. The markets are defined by the trading asset of choice, strike price, timeframe (time to maturity), 
and direction (up/down).

## Example:
 For instance, a trade could be created on the following prediction: 
 
 ETH will be above (Up) 1.8k USD 15 mins later

When the position reaches time to expiry (i.e. 15 mins later):
- if the outcome of the above prediction is true, then the trader makes a profit. 
- If the outcome of the above statement is false, then the trader takes a loss.

These markets offer a fantastic way of trading price action, 
hedging high leveraged positions and balancing your exposure to specific assets. 
It is a preferred insttruments for traders looking to avoid the complexities and 
heightened risks associated with perpetual contracts, such as funding rates, potential for liquidation, and uncapped risk.
