# Fee

## Settlement Fee:

Settlement Fee (or trading fee) is the fee paid by takers (traders) to the makers (LPs). 
Buffer employs a "Dynamic Pricing" mechanism to incentivize or penalize takers, with the aim of maintaining balance in the Open Interest (OI)
across various markets and promoting diversification among takers. 
Dynamic pricing is designed to impose higher fees during periods of market volatility. 

Fee is collected at the time when takers open a position and dynamically scales, influenced by trading volume, and payouts.
With this mechanism in place payouts can range between a maximum dynamic of 90% to a minimum dynamic of 75% or lower.


## Platform Fee:

Placing Up/Down trades on Buffer incurs a flat fee for interactions on Buffer's 1 Click architecture that enables a 2x faster, and full gasless trading experience. 
This is a fixed amount used to cover the Router fee for opening & closing a trade.

:::note
Due to the recent gas spikes on Arbitrum, we have implemented the platform fee model as dynamic. 
The fee is automatically adjusted every 24 hours based on the average cost incurred by the keepers.

## Fee Distribution:

100% of the settlement fees to Buffer Liquidity Providers, $BFR Stakers and $BFR BuyBack and Burn.
