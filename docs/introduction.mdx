## What is Buffer Finance?
Buffer is the first decentralized price prediction market built on Arbitrum to support both
crypto and non-crypto (forex, commodities) binary markets and timeframes as short as 1 min. 

The platform currently supports two primary types of prediction markets: Up/Down and Above/Below. 
However, the potential to expand and customize market types/formats is extensive. With the launch of v2.6, Buffer's 
probability based are accessible to anyone permissionlessly. 
This flexibility opens up endless possibilities for creating tailored and advanced prediction/trading products.

Every market is a ERC-721 contract that mints positions as a NFTs. 
Traders can purchase a position using supported collateral (USDC/ARB). 
When the market resolves the winning positions received a payout while the 
losing positions expire worthless. 
To provide a comprehensive trading and hedging experience the protocol also supports 
leverage trading of up to 100x, allowing traders to intuitively hedge risks and adjust 
exposure structure on a single platform.
