## Buy Back and burn
See BIP-02 for details on buyback and burn. We see the ultimate pathway to a community win is through a revenue-based "buy and burn" strategy.
There are two key levers we control:  
- Expand Demand
- Reduce Supply

These levers behave differently when a product is early and there is a small number of users vs. when the product is mature and a large number of users exist.

## Supply allocation:
* **~28 million in circulation**
       * 20 million BFR reserved to be distributed as esBFR. Out of 20 million:
       * 3 million is reserved for later migrators
       * 2 million is reserved for OTC sales to raise working capital & POL
       * The remaining 15 million esBFR are being emitted at 100,000 esBFR/month to the BFR staking pool. Any changes to the emissions can be done after voting

* **10 million for DEX liquidity will be used for active market making on Uniswap v3 and liquidity mining rewards.**
       * All fees earned while making the market will be re-invested in it.

* **10 million community & team compensation**
       * To be released at 200,000 $BFR/ month for the next 50 months ( only liquid $BFR emission)
       * Includes team and community member compensation and all previous vesting schedules

* **25 million of the supply was locked under a 6-month cliff - post-cliff period**
       * On June 5th, 20M BFR tokens were burned as per community consensus received for BIP-02
